# End-To-End Data Analytics Project 2024

### Using SQL & Power BI

##### Introduction

This project is an adaptation of a project by the same name by Absent Data. It is a YouTube tutorial which I've followed for my own learning experience. I would like to thank Absent Data for this invaluable tutorial which has taught me a lot about SQL and Power BI. While most of the code is similar, there might be minor differences found since my versions of SQL and Power BI are different and I had to find a work around in some instances. 

Please follow Absent Data on YouTube as his videos are a fantastic opportunity for anyone who wants to learn such valuable skills.

The project begins in SQL by uploading and joining multiple tables together and then cleaning the data according to the requirements of the project.

We then move to the Power BI part by importing our SQL code into it and then creating a dashboard from scratch. While GitHub supports uploading the code but I won't be able to share the actual dashboard here. It can be available for viewing upon request.
